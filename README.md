# uLQR: Micro iLQR
## Unleasing nonlinear trajectory optimization onto the realm of microcontroller

This project aims to deploy nonlinear trajectory optimization onto microcontroller. 
The goal is to write a dependency-free implementation of iterative LQR (iLQR) and is 
optimized for running on resource-constrained compute systems. This project is still 
under development, but we hope to have some examples running soon!
